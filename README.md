- "What is the main topic of this document?"
- "Summarize the key points in the first chapter"
- "What are the conclusions mentioned in the document?"
- "List all the important dates mentioned"
- "What methodology was used in this research?"

## Testing Hallucination Prevention

Run the test script to verify all features work correctly:
```bash
python test_hallucination_prevention.py
```

This will test:
- Confidence scoring functionality
- Source citation accuracy
- Hallucination detection with non-existent information
